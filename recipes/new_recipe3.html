Recipe pages should include the following:

    An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.

    Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading 
    followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

    Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list 
    of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

    Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered 
    list of the steps needed for making the dish.
