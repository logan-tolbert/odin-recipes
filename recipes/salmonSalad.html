            <p>
                Packed with flavor, this foolproof Salmon Salad with canned salmon
                takes 5 minutes and is so simple to make! It calls for Greek yogurt
                instead of mayo for a healthier take on the classic that's absolutely
                delicious. Enjoy it for a protein-packed lunch with crackers, over
                lettuce, on bread, or with a spoon. Great for meal prep!
