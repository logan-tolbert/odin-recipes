        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p><q>Warning: This is not the casserole of your childhood (assuming you grew up pre-2000s). This chicken taco
                casserole isn't laden with canned soups or so rich it's overwhelming. It is maxed out on flavor, with
                seasoned chicken, green chiles, black beans, corn, and just enough cheese to glue everything together.
                Layer
                in some corn tortillas, and my secret casserole weapon, crispy tostadas, and you are in for a treat.</q>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees farhenheit</li>
            <li>In a large bowl mix the chicken, green chiles, 1 taco seasoning packet, and a third of the shredded
                cheese. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, add olive oil and onion. Season with the salt and the second taco seasoning packet
                and cook over medium-high heat until the onions soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the corn and cook for 1 to 2
                minutes. Add the black beans and fire-roasted tomatoes and cook for a few minutes to combine flavors and
                break down the tomatoes a bit.<br>Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in a third of the remaining
                shredded cheese. </li>
            <li>Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray and line the bottom with 8 overlapping tostada
                shells. (If you don't have these, you can use 6 corn tortillas, but the crispy tostadas work
                best.)<br>Top the tostadas with the chicken filling. Top with 6 corn tortillas to cover most of the
                chicken layer. <br>Spread the black bean and corn mixture on top of the tortillas. Cover with the last 6
                corn tortillas. It's okay to rip them up to get even coverage. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake the casserole, uncovered, for 30 minutes, until it is bubbling and the top is crispy.<br>
                Cool it for 5 minutes. Slice portions with a knife and use a spatula to serve. Garnish with sour cream
                and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
        <aside>Refrigerate leftovers for up to 5 days or wrap tightly and freeze for up to 3 months.</aside>
